# MyPlaces

This app reads Google Earth place data from a KML file and shows the data in a list and map format. The information is stored to Core Data so it can be accessed later even if there is no internet access.

I use this app to store trivia about various points of interest in New York City, which I can then use to bore people whenever the opportunity arises.
